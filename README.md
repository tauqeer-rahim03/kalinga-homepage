-   **Custom Grid Systems:** Uses CSS Grid and Flexbox to manage complex layouts (Bestsellers, Collections, Reviews).
-   **Native Scroll Snapping:** Horizontal scrolling sections on mobile (Reviews, Gifting, Promos) use CSS Scroll Snap for a native app-like feel without heavy JavaScript libraries.

    -   Functional Category & Filter tabs.
    -   Search bar focus effects.
    -   Color swatch selection logic.

    -   **Navigation:** Scrollable pill menu on mobile vs. standard links on desktop.
    -   **Conditional Rendering:** "Social UGC" section appears only on mobile; "Recently Viewed" layout adapts contextually.
